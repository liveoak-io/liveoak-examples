LiveOak Scripting Examples
==========================

There are currently 4 basic scripting examples. All 4 of these examples are based around resource triggered scripts and as such are triggered when a resource is accessed or modified.

* helloscript: simple example which prints messages to the log

* formatscript: example to enforce a specific structure when creating a new storage resource

* metadatascript: example to modify incoming requests and outgoing responses

* useragentscript: example to show accessing other LiveOak resources using the client

* ephemeralscript: example to show how to delete entries using the client and restrict editing storage entries

Please see the README.md for each example for more information.
